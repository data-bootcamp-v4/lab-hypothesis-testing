    "Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing Lab, where we embark on an enlightening journey through the realm of statistical decision-making! In this laboratory, we delve into various scenarios, applying the powerful tools of hypothesis testing to scrutinize and interpret data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From testing the mean of a single sample (One Sample T-Test), to investigating differences between independent groups (Two Sample T-Test), and exploring relationships within dependent samples (Paired Sample T-Test), our exploration knows no bounds. Furthermore, we'll venture into the realm of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), unraveling the complexities of comparing means across multiple groups.\n",
